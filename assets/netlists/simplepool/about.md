## About simplepool Netlist

This netlist is a simple demonstrator, for users to gain insight into how TokenSPICE is structured. It includes EVM agents.

It has two agents:

- DataPublisherAgent "pub1"
- BPoolAgent "pool1"

As one might expect, pub1 publishes datatokens & a pool. The pool is an EVM-based robot that responds accordingly.
