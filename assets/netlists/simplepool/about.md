## About simplepool Netlist

This netlist is a simple demonstrator, for users to gain insight into how TokenSPICE is structured. It includes EVM agents.

[Here's the code](netlist.py). It's just one file.

It has these agents:

- [PublisherAgent](../../agents/PublisherAgent.py) "pub1" - initially just this
- [PoolAgent](../../agents/PoolAgent.py) "pool1", "pool2", ... - these get added by publisher over time
