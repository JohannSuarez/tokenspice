# üê† TokenSPICE: EVM Agent-Based Token Simulator

TokenSPICE can be used to help design, tune, and verify tokenized ecosystems in an overall Token Engineering (TE) flow.

TokenSPICE simulates tokenized ecosystems using an agent-based approach.

Each "agent" is a class. Has a wallet, and does work to earn $. One models the system by wiring up agents, and tracking metrics (kpis). Agents may be written in pure Python, or with an EVM-based backend.

A "netlist" defines what you simulate, and how. It wires up a collection of agents to interact in a given way. You can write your own netlists to simulate whatever you like. The `assets/netlists` directory has examples.

TokenSPICE was meant to be simple. It makes no claims on "best". Maybe you'll find it useful.

# üèó Initial Setup

## Set up environment

Open a new terminal and:
```console
#ensure brownie's *not* installed. It causes problems
pip uninstall eth-brownie

#clone repo
git clone https://github.com/oceanprotocol/tokenspice.git tokenspice
cd tokenspice

#make sure we're not in env't; remove old env'ts
conda deactivate
conda remove --name tokenspiceenv --all

#create a python-anaconda env't in location ~/anaconda3/envs/tokenspiceenv
conda env create -f environment.yml

#activate env't
conda activate tokenspiceenv
```

## Get Ganache running

Open a new terminal and:
```console
cd tokenspice

#active env't
conda activate tokenspiceenv

#run ganache
./ganache.py
```

Note: you could run ganache directly, but then you have to add many special arguments. The script above does that for you.

## Deploy the smart contracts to ganache

Open a separate terminal.


```console
#Grab the contracts code from main, *OR* (see below)
git clone https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts

#OR grab from a branch. Here's Alex's V4.1 prototype branch
git clone --branch feature/1mm-prototype_alex https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts
```

Then, deploy. In that same terminal:
```console
cd contracts

#one-time install
npm i

#compile .sol, deploy to ganache, update contracts/artifacts/*.json
npm run deploy
```

Finally, open `tokenspice/tokenspice.ini` and set `ARTIFACTS_PATH = contracts/artifacts`.
* Now, TokenSPICE knows where to find each contract on ganache (address.json file)
* And, it knows what each contract's interface is (*.json files).


## Test one EVM-based test

```console
conda activate tokenspiceenv
pytest web3engine/test/test_btoken.py 
```

## First usage of tsp

First, add pwd to bash path.
```console
export PATH=$PATH:.
```

`tsp` is the command-line module. To see help, call it with no args.
```console
tsp
```

## Run simulation

Here's an example on a supplied netlist `w3sl_noevm.py`.

Simulate the netlist, storing results to `outdir_csv`.
```console
tsp run assets/netlists/w3sl_noevm.py outdir_csv outdir_csv
```

Output plots to `outdir_png`, and view them.
```console
tsp plot outdir_csv outdir_png
eog outdir_png
```

# üèÑ Do Simulations, Make Changes

## Do Once, At Session Start

**Start chain.** Open a new terminal and:
```console
cd ~/code/tokenspice
conda activate tokenspiceenv
./ganache.py
```

**Deploy contracts.** Open a new terminal and:
```console
cd ~/code/contracts
npm run deploy
```

## Do >=1 Times in a Session

**Update simulation code.** Open a new terminal. In it:
```console
cd ~/code/tokenspice
conda activate tokenspiceenv
./emacs <path/foo.py>
#then change foo.py in editor
```

**Run tests.** In the same terminal as before:
```console
#run a single pytest-based test
pytest tests/test_foo.py::test_foobar

#run a single pytest-based test file
pytest tests/test_foo.py

#run all tests in engine/ directory
pytest engine/

#run all tests except web3engine/ (slow)
pytest --ignore=web3engine

#run all tests
pytest

#run static type-checking. Dynamic is automatic.
mypy --config-file mypy.ini ./
```

## Test that everything is working

```console
conda activate tokenspiceenv
pytest
```

**Commit changes.**
```console
git add <changed filename>
git status -s [[check status]]
git commit -m <my commit message>
git push

#or

git status -s [[check status]]
git commit -am <my commit message>
git push
```

# üêü Updating Envt

You don't need this info at the beginning, but it's good to know about as you make changes.

To change dependencies, first update `environment.yml`. Then:
```console
#make sure env't is active
conda activate tokenspiceenv

#main update. The 'prune' part gets rid of unused pkgs
conda env update --name tokenspiceenv --file environment.yml --prune
```

Leave environment:
```console
conda deactivate
```

Delete environment:
```console
conda remove --name tokenspiceenv --all
```

# ü¶ë Netlists and Custom Simulations

## About Agents 

- All agents are written in Python
- Each Agent has an AgentWallet, which holds a Web3Wallet. The Web3Wallet holds a private key and creates TXs. 
- Some agents may wrap smart contracts deployed to EVM (eg BPool).

## Changing Sim Structure & Parameters

The **netlist** defines what you simulate, and how.

Sample netlists, given below, can be run out-of-the-box.

Or run your own custom simulation, by changing the netlist. You can change:
- Simulation run parameters
- What metrics (KPIs) to log, later called by `tsp plot`
- System-level structure & parameters - how agents are connected
- Individual agent structure & parameters - each agent instance. To change agent structure, you'll need to change its module (py or sol code). Unit tests are recommended.

## Sample Netlists

Netlists live at `assets/netlists/`.

### W3SL Netlist

W3SL = Web3 Sustainability Loop
 The original version was tuned for the [Web3 Sustainability Loop](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e). However you can rewire the "netlist" of "agents" to simulate whatever you like. 

(FIXME add images - see tokenspice0.1)

### Ocean V3 Netlist

System-level design is W3SL. But now higher fidelity is added to the "data ecosystem" part. This is in order to better [Ocean Market](https://market.oceanprotocol.com) publishing, pool creation, staking, and data consumption.

The actual netlist is WIP.

### Ocean V4 Netlist

Starts with Ocean V3, then makes staking safer via one-sided AMM bots. WIP.

### Done so far:
- Wrote Ocean Market V4.1 prototype smart contracts
- Drew schematics for V3 & V4.1
- Adapted TokenSPICE code
  - Run EVM end-to-end via ganache
  - Lets third-parties deploy to ganache, then uses at their ABIs
  - ABIs are wrapped as classes, which are inside agents.
  - Already include: Ocean datatokens, Ocean datatoken factory, Ocean friendly fork of Balancer AMM, Balancer AMM factory, etc. Have Unit tests for all.
  - Started writing Python-level agent behaviors
- **Be able to specify a netlist and run, without having to fork** [#30](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/tokenspice/issues/30)

### Roadmap - Near Term

This work is geared towards verifying & tuning Ocean V4.1, which updates Ocean smart contracts for better IDOs through one-sided market makers and more.

1. **Get *some* overall loop running that includes at least one EVM agent** [#34](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/tokenspice/issues/34)
2. **Improve Continuous Integration** - various issues, see kanban 
3. **Finish + verify Ocean V3 agents** [#28](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/tokenspice/issues/28). AKA: System identification: high-fidelity model of Ocean V3 (w/ Balancer V1); fit the model to observed on-chain dynamics
4. **Finish + verify Ocean V4.1 agents** [#29](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/tokenspice/issues/29). AKA: Verification: high-fidelity model of Ocean V4 (w/ Balancer V2) base design, and the efficacy of each proposed mechanism.
5. **Design space exploration**: tuning of Ocean V4.1 (w/ Balancer V2 design). Manual or optimization-based.

### Roadmap - Longer Term

6. System identification: high-fidelity model of whole Balancer V1 ecosystem; fit the model to observed on-chain dynamics (up to when V2 released). Bring in uncontrollable variables (probabilistic & worst-case).
7. System identification: high-fidelity model of whole Balancer V1 & V2 ecosystem; fit the model to observed on-chain dynamics
8. Design space exploration: tuning of Balancer V2 Strategies to minimize IL and other objectives & constraints. Account for uncontrollable variables (probabilistic & worst-case).
10. Open-ended design space exploration: evolve solidity or EVM bytecode, go nuts. AI DAOs that own themselves. This will be fun:). But one step at a time.

And much more - it's largely up to the community. For example, it would be cool to have a [machinations.io](https://machinations.io/)-like interface:)

# üêã Benefits of EVM Agent Simulation

TokenSPICE 2 and other EVM agent-based simulators have these benefits:
- Faster and less error prone, because the model = the Solidity code. Don‚Äôt have to port any existing Solidity code into Python, just wrap it. Don‚Äôt have to write lower-fidelity equations.
- Enables rapid iterations of writing Solidity code -> simulating -> changing Solidity code -> simulating. At both the parameter level and the structural level. 
- Can quickly integrate Balancer V2 code. Then extend to model other AMMs. And other DeFi code. Etc etc.
- Plays well with other pure Python agents. Each agent can wrap Solidity, or be pure Python. 
- Super high fidelity simulations, since it uses the actual code itself. Enables modeling of uncontrollable variables, both random (probabilistic) ones and worst-case ones. 
- Can build higher-level CAD tools, that have TokenSPICE 2 in the loop: 
  - 3-sigma verification - verification of random variables, including Monte Carlo analysis
  - Worst-case analysis - verification across worst-case condition
  - Corner extraction - finding representative ‚Äúcorners‚Äù -- a small handful of points in uncontrollable variable space to simulate against for rapid design-space exploration
  - Local optimization - wiggle controllable params to optimize for objectives & constraints
  - Global optimization - ‚Äú‚Äù, with affordances to not get stuck
  - Synthesis - ‚Äú‚Äù but wiggle code structure itself in addition to parameters
  - Variation-aware synthesis - all of the above at once. This isn‚Äôt easy! But it‚Äôs possible. Example: use MOJITO (http://trent.st/mojito/), but use TokenSPICE 2 (not SPICE) and Solidity building blocks (not circuit ones) 
- Mental model is general enough to extend to Vyper, LLL, and direct EVM bytecode. Can extend to non-EVM blockchain, and multi-chain scenarios. Can extend to work with hierarchical building blocks. 
- Can also do real-time analysis / optimization / etc against live chains: grab the latest chain‚Äôs snapshot into ganache, run a local analysis / optimization etc for a few seconds or minutes, then do transaction(s) on the live chain. This can lead to trading systems, failure monitoring, more.

In short, there's a lot of promise. But, the code is young! There's a lot of software engineering work to be done. This can evolve into something very exciting:)
